        â€œGemma has been a wonderful help in the renovation of my central Bath
        apartment. Gemma has been professionally trained which I specifically
        wanted, as I had already interior design experience but needed some
        extra expert guidance. There were several space planning issues and her
        spatial planning was brilliant, so I had the confidence to buy furniture
        items that I knew would fit. Gemma sourced some AMAZING PIECES that I
        would never have found on my own."
