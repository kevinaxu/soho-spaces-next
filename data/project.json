    "description": "When we asked Kevin to tell us about a place that brought back good memories and made him feel at ease, he began describing the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University. It's where he used to spend many late nights listening to music while studying or reading a book. He loved the Gothic architecture and how the stained glass windows cast colorful patterns across the floors. He missed the smell of old books mixed with the faint aroma of wood polish. With its rows of towering bookshelves and dimly-lit brass lamps, somehow the library felt both grand and cozy at the same time. With that inspiration in mind, we created this Dark Academia living room - a space where Kevin could gather his thoughts, put on a record, and relax with a good book. We chose modern yet timeless furniture, complemented it with some antique pieces, and balanced rich, dark hues with ornate gold detailing. Full story below.",
